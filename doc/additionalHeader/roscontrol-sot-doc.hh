\section sec_intro Introduction
This package provides a link between the Stack-Of-Tasks framework and
roscontrol. It assumes that a robot has a <a
href="https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/search?q=hardware_interface&unscoped_q=hardware_interface">hardware_interface</a>
provided by roscontrol. It also assumes that the robot has a Device class
specialized for the robot. For instance in the passive walker yoyoman available
<a href="https://github.com/Gepetto/yoyoman01_robot">here</a>, this device is
provided in the directory sot-yoyoman01.

In general a wrapper is needed to make this Device class usable in the robot
itself, or in a simulator (Gazebo, or OpenHRP). When an abstract interface is
provided, which is the case with ros-control, a yaml file is sufficient to do
the wrapping. For two working examples you can have a look to the <a
href="https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/talos_metapkg_ros_control_sot">package
for the Talos robot</a>, or the directory <a
href="https://github.com/Gepetto/yoyoman01_robot/tree/master/yoyoman_metapkg_ros_control_sot">yoyoman_metapkg_ros_control_sot</a>
for the yoyoman passive walker.

\section sec_install Install

\subsection subsec_install_bin Binary installation

For binary installation we rely on the robotpkg project which is providing an
apt repository. Please follow the instructions given <a
href="http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/debian.html">here</a> to access this apt
repository. Once this is done, installing roscontrol_sot can be done with:
\code{.sh}
sudo apt-get install robotpkg-roscontrol-sot
\endcode

WARNING: the roscontrol-sot provided by robotpkg is compiled over the
PAL-robotics fork of roscontrol and not the ros packages roscontrol.

\subsection subsec_install_src Source Installation

First you must install dynamic-graph-bridge-v3:
\code{.sh}
sudo apt-get install robotpkg-dynamic-graph-bridge-v3
\endcode
This should be done after following the previous step to access the robotpkg apt
repository.

Then you can clone the repository:
\code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/roscontrol_sot.git
\endcode

You can either compile it with:
\code{.sh}
cd roscontrol_sot
make _build
cd _build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your_path ..
make install
\endcode

or, if you are in a ros workspace:
\code{.sh}
catkin_make
\endcode

\section sec_introduction Overview

\subsection roscontrol

To control a robot it is necessary to implement the following loop
\code{.c}
void rtloop()
{
  ReadSensors();
  UpdateCmd();
  WriteCmd();
}
\endcode

ReadSensors() and the WriteCmd() are
functions accessing the real hardware or a simulator to read the sensors
and write the command respectively.
On the other hand the UpdateCmd() functions implements a the computation of
a control law.
The roscontrol framework is providing an abstract interface to the hardware
interface and the controllers.

The previous code is then rewritten the following way:
\code{.c}
void * RosControlRealTimeLoop(void *argument)
{
  aRobotHW->read();
  aControllerManager->UpdateCmd();
  aRobotHW->write();
}
\endcode

The interaction between the controller manager and the robot hardware is done
through a hardware interface exposing double which are either publishing sensor
information or control values.
The abstract interface is allowing to have a normalized way to interact with
the robot hardware.

\subsection subsec_sot Stack-Of-Tasks.

The stack of tasks is loaded thanks to a dynamical library.

In order to exchange informations between the robot and the Stack-Of-Tasks,
maps of doubles are used.
The maps provide sensor information and the value of the control computed by
the SoT.

The size of double vector and the map key are computed automatically depending
on the number of sensors and actuators provided by the robot_hardware_interface.

\section section_yamlfile Setting the YAML file.

\subsection namespace
All the parameters regarding the SoT inside roscontrol are in the namespace
\code{.sh}
/sot_controller
\endcode

\subsection subsection_setsot Setting the SoT dynamic library which contains the
robot device.

In order to control a robot, an appropriate YAML file need to be written such
as: \code{.sh} sot_robot_param.yaml \endcode

If its SoT device entity is located inside the following dynamic library:
\code{.sh}
/opt/openrobots/lib/libsot-robot-controller.so
\endcode

Then inside the file sot_robot_param.yaml
\code{.yaml}
  libname: libsot-robot-controller.so
\endcode

\subsection subsec_spec_act_state Specifying the actuated state vector
To map the joints from the URDF model to the SoT actuated state vector, it is
simply done by giving the ordered list of the joints name in the URDF model. For
instance: \code{.sh} joint_names: [ leg_left_1_joint, leg_left_2_joint,
leg_left_3_joint, leg_left_4_joint, leg_left_5_joint, leg_left_6_joint,
    leg_right_1_joint, leg_right_2_joint, leg_right_3_joint, leg_right_4_joint,
leg_right_5_joint, leg_right_6_joint, torso_1_joint,torso_2_joint,head_1_joint,
head_2_joint, arm_left_1_joint, arm_left_2_joint, arm_left_3_joint,
arm_left_4_joint, arm_left_5_joint, arm_left_6_joint, arm_left_7_joint,
gripper_left_joint, arm_right_1_joint, arm_right_2_joint, arm_right_3_joint,
arm_right_4_joint, arm_right_5_joint, arm_right_6_joint, arm_right_7_joint,
gripper_right_joint
  ]
\endcode

\subsection subsec_spec_map Specifying the map between the ros control data and
the sot device entity.

This ros-control plugin connect to the robot (or simulated robot) by requesting
the available ressources such as: <ol> <li> motor-angles: Reading of the motor
position</li> <li> joint-angles: Reading of the joint position</li> <li>
velocities: Reading/estimation of the joint velocities</li> <li> torques:
Reading/estimation of the joint torques</li> <li> cmd-position: Command for the
joint positions</li> <li> cmd-effort: Command for the joint torques</li>
</ol>

For instance the map for a robot which maps __cmd-position__ to __joints__ and
__cmd-effort__ to __effort__ in its device will have have the following lines in
its param file: \code{.sh} map_rc_to_sot_device: { motor-angles: motor-angles ,
  joint-angles: joint-angles, velocities: velocities,
  torques: torques, cmd-joints: joints, cmd-effort: effort }
\endcode

\subsection spec_cont_mode Specifying the control mode
Robots with __ros-control__ can be controlled either in position (POSITION) or
in torque (EFFORT) using the __control_mode__ variable:

\code{.sh}
     control_mode: EFFORT
\endcode
